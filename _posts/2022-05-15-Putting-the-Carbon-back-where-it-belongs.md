Oxidizing C and O_2 has yielded X PetaWatt over the previous 3 centuries.

In order to return to pre-industrial atmospheric composition, the carbon is being removed from the atmosphere. To split the C and O_2 back, we will need to spend at least X PetaWatt (at an optimistic efficiency of 100%).

This process will yield approx. [355 billion tons](https://osf.io/dkmwy/download#:~:text=The%20total%20mass%20of%20both,%25%20of%20the%20Earth%20mass) of pure carbon which will require safe storage. The safe storage must at least protect from fire, heat, and theft.

We propose storing the superfluous carbon in the underground caverns left behind in exhausted oil fields.
